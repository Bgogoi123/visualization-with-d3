# Smiling Cursor and Sketchbook

## Smiling Cursor
> A smiling emoji moves along with the cursor in a specific area.

## Sketchbook
> A simple clone of " MS Paint". 
> We can choose from a variety of brush types, and alter the size of the brush.
> 'Undo' and 'Redo' buttons are present. An eraser is also included for cleaning the canvas. 
> A colour palette is also provided if we want to utilise various hues. 

> If you have a friend, you can open the link and start painting on the canvas jointly, thanks to this application's websocket feature.
